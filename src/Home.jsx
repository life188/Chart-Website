            I am currently a third-year Software Engineering student at the
            University of Ottawa with experience in full-stack development as
            well as Product Managment. I love building scalable, applications in
            my free time such as SpendSmart as well as my Weather App. I have
            worked modern tools like React, Docker, and AWS, and I'm always
            eager to learn, adapt, and make meaningful contributions. I am
            currently taking a UI design course, where Iâ€™m learning about design
            elements.
